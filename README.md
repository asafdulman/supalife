SupaLife is an app that helps people to measure and then analyze their life, by different parts of life.

In addition, there is a feature to add actions.The app will check which parts of your life (That you rated) need a proactive attitude, and will suggest particular actions to make.

This project was built with React, Scss, NodeJs, and MongoDB.

A big difference for me was the use of React Hooks instead of Classes.

I used some materialUI components, but only for some animations with modals and messages. Other than that, the whole app was created with CSS.

The purpose of the app is to learn and understand better the core of React and Node. But, now the app is on the web at https://supalife.herokuapp.com/#/, anyone can use it and measure his/her life by categories.
