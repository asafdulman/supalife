# supalife

SupaLife is an app which helps people to measure and then analyze thier life, by different parts in life. In addition, there is a feature to add actions.

The app will check which parts of your life (That you rated) need proactive attitude, and will suggest particular actions to make.

This project was build with React, Scss, NodeJs and MongoDB.

A big diffrence for me was the use of React Hooks instead of Classes.

I used some materialUI components, but only for some animations with modals and messages. Othar than that, the whole app was created with CSS.

The purpose of the app is to learn and understand better the core of React and Node.

But, now the app is on the web at https://supalife.herokuapp.com/#/ , anyone can use it and measure his/her life by categories.
